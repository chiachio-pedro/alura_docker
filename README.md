# Alura Docker

Docker project, created as part of the online training "Docker: Criando e Gerenciando ContÃªineres" from @alura-challenges, an online school for coding and software development. The objective of this repository is serve as a knowledge library for me (@chiachio-pedro) while learning some new software development stuff...

## What is Docker?

Problems that Docker solves:

- Port conflict.
- Change versions in a practical way.
- Control of memory and cpu resources.
- Simplified maintenance process.

Similar to a virtual machine generated through a Hypervisor layer, which will have an isolated OS. And what is the advantage of Docker? Docker will be able to run multiple isolated applications through containers, without having to simulate a new OS.

Why are containers lighter?

While a virtual machine simulates the operating system as a whole, containers operate as if they were processes, so their consumption is lower than that of a virtual machine.

How do containers ensure isolation?

In order to guarantee the isolation of a container in an operating system, they operate through the concept of "Namespaces":

- PID: Provides for isolation of processes operating within a container.
- NET: Provides for the isolation of network interfaces.
- IPC: Provides for isolation of communication between processes and shared memory.
- MNT: Provisions for isolation of filesystem/mount points.
- UTS: Provides kernel isolation. Acting as if the container were another host.

How do containers work without an OS?

Through the aforementioned "Namespace", the UTS, the container is able to isolate a part of the Kernel that will only be used for that process, so the native OS of the machine has an isolated part of the system as a whole that will act as the container's OS.

How do containers manage system resources?

Just as "Namespaces" are responsible for isolating the container in the operating system, there is another concept responsible for managing the allocation of resources in each container, the "CGroups".

## Usage: 

For the Docker container to work, it needs an image, an image that can be found locally or through Docker Hub.

Main steps:

- Reproduce Docker image from a locally made file struct or by cloning a repository.
- Build the Docker image locally.
- Start a new container based on the Docker image built in the last step.
- Share that container through Docker Hub.

NOTE: Docker containers are only running as they perform some task, if the task is terminated the container will also be terminated.

### Docker execution flow:

Searches for the image locally -> Downloads the image if not found locally -> Validates the image hash -> Runs the container.

### What is a "hash"?

Hash is a mathematical function that converts a file of any size into a fixed length code of letters and numbers. This data representation ends up serving as the file's "fingerprint".

### What are images?

Images are a set of independent layers that when joined together form an image. They can be reused by several containers without the need for increased storage, the image being only the base and the container being the Read/Wright layer that will interact with the image.

### And what are layers?

Layers are instructions present in a Dockerfile that will be grouped together to form an image. Layers can be reused between different images and cannot be modified, any changes made will be embedded in a new Read/Wright layer from the container.

### Docker Creation Flow:

**Docker File** ---**Build**--> **Image** ---**Run**--> **Container**

### The problem of storage:

Because containers are temporary Read/Write layers over images, their storage is considered as the "virtual storage" (image size) plus the "storage" (changes made within the Read/Write layer), when shutting down a container the Read/Wirte layer information is lost, as aforementioned, and in order for this not to occur it is necessary to use the concept of "volumes".

Types of Volumes:

- Volume: Instances a volume within Docker itself to be used for file storage without relying on the OS mount point.

- Bind Mount: Binds the OS mount point to the container filesystem.

- Tmpfs Mount: [**Only works on Linux host**] Persists data in the host's memory, but does not write it to the container's Read/Write layer.
